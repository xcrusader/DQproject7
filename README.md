# DQproject7
SAT is a test taken annually by high school seniors in the US. The test helps colleges filter students for admissions and average SAT scores help identify school performance.

The city of New York has published SAT scores by high school in addition to other demographic data. Using this dataset and dataset associated to NY real estate we analyse whether SAT scores are biased. We look at whether bias exists based on the race, institution/school and location a student is associated to.

The learning objectives of this project include cleaning and aggregation of multiple datasets and gleaning insights from across them.
